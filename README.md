# Hello World in Every Programming Language

Welcome to my project! This repository contains "Hello World" programs written in as many programming languages as possible. The goal is to create a comprehensive collection of "Hello World" implementations.

## Project Goal

The goals of this project are:
- To create a centralized collection of "Hello World" examples.
- To allow developers to explore and learn different programming languages.
- To celebrate the diversity of programming and scripting languages.

## Repository Structure

Each programming language has its own "Hello World" program. These files are named following the pattern `helloworld.<extension>`, where `<extension>` is the file extension for the respective language.

### Example Directory
Here’s an example of how the files are structured:
```
helloworld.py    # Python
helloworld.js    # JavaScript
helloworld.c     # C
helloworld.java  # Java
helloworld.rb    # Ruby
...
```
